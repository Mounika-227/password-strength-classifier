# 🔐 Password Strength Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **strength of a password** (Weak, Medium, or Strong) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

It demonstrates skills in:
- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature extraction with TF-IDF  
- Model training & evaluation using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Contains a list of passwords labeled with their strength.  
- Labels: **weak**, **medium**, **strong**  
- Cleaned to remove duplicates and invalid values.  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed:
- **Password Strength Distribution** visualization  
- **Password Length Histogram**  
- **Average Password Length by Strength**  
- Summary statistics of password lengths  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, ensured correct labels.  
2. **Feature Extraction** – Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert passwords into numerical features.  
3. **Model Training** – Trained and evaluated:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Naive Bayes  
4. **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy Score, Classification Report.

## 📈 Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** `99.996%`  
- **Naive Bayes Accuracy:** `99.199%`
